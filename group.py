"""
Create an example instance, in an editor or a notebook, of a structure for this group:

Jill is 26, a biologist and she is Zalika's friend and John's partner.
Zalika is 28, an artist, and Jill's friend
John is 27, a writer, and Jill's partner.
Nash is 34, a chef, John's cousin and Zalika's landlord.
Some things you may wish to consider in your model:

Does it allow people who have no job?
Does it allow people with no connections?
Does it assume that connections are always reciprocal (e.g. if A is B's friend, does B automatically consider A a friend too?)
